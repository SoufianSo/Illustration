          <h1>real beauty resides in imperfection</h1>

          <p>
            In a digital era, we sometimes feel the need to interact with
            something more human that will make us appreciate both the beauty
            and the imperfection of something made by hand.

          <h1>expressiveness is... the new black</h1>

          <p>
            This series of illustrations paradoxically combines absurdity and a
            deep sense of childishness and naivety.

            Welcome to my space for experiments! Look at this like a journey we
            can take together every step of the way, beginning another chapter
            with each new phase of the project development. And who knows where
            it will take us?

            Each illustration offers the possibility of limitless
            interpretations and uses and everyone can give it its own meaning.
            It depends only on each one's creativity and free spirit.
